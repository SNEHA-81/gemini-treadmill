# gemini-treadmill

Two years ago, when I started regular cardio, my trainer told me:
“You know, treadmills are banned in some places because of injuries, but everyone still uses them!”

That stuck with me. Treadmill running is everywhere, but so are the injuries, often from small mistakes nobody notices.

I love running outdoors, but I realized the same form mistakes happen inside, and on a treadmill, they’re even riskier.
Inspired by Farza’s gemini-bball project, I thought:
Why not use AI to help people spot treadmill mistakes before they get hurt?

So I built this:

-Drop in your treadmill video

-AI grabs the most important snapshots

-Instantly flags bad form and injury risks

Simple, practical, and hopefully a little safer for everyone.
